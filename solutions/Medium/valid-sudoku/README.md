# Valid Sudoku

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**LeetCode Link:** [Open Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/)

## Problem Description
Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

1. Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
2. Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.
3. Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

* A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
* Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = 
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: board = 
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.
```

**Constraints:**

* `board.length == 9`
* `board[i].length == 9`
* `board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.

## Solution

- **Language:** Python3
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Approach
The algorithm uses hash sets to keep track of the numbers seen in each row, column, and 3x3 sub-box. We iterate through each cell of the 9x9 board. If a cell contains a digit, we calculate its corresponding row, column, and sub-box index (using the formula `(r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)`). If the digit is already present in any of the respective sets, the board is invalid and we return False. Otherwise, we add the digit to the sets and continue. If we successfully check all cells, we return True.

### Code
```py
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        boxes = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        
        for r in range(9):
            for c in range(9):
                val = board[r][c]
                if val == '.':
                    continue
                
                box_idx = (r // 3) * 3 + (c // 3)
                if val in rows[r] or val in cols[c] or val in boxes[box_idx]:
                    return False
                
                rows[r].add(val)
                cols[c].add(val)
                boxes[box_idx].add(val)
                
        return True
```
